# OrderBot-Using-Groq-Api

This project is a simple but functional chatbot that leverages Groq's language model API to simulate conversations with users. The chatbot is designed to be friendly and helpful, providing responses based on the user's inputs. It uses a loop to maintain the conversation, allowing continuous interaction until the user decides to end the chat.

The chatbot is initialized with a system message that defines its behavior as a "friendly chatbot," and it uses this context to generate responses throughout the session. The user can interact with the chatbot by typing messages, and the chatbot will respond in real-time.

## Key Features:
User-Friendly Interaction: The chatbot is designed to be easy to use, with a simple input/output interface.
Dynamic Responses: The chatbot generates responses based on the conversation history, providing contextually relevant replies.
Session Persistence: The conversation history is maintained throughout the session, allowing the chatbot to generate more coherent responses.
Customizable: The chatbotâ€™s behavior can be easily modified by changing the system message or adjusting other parameters like the temperature, which controls the randomness of the responses.
## Technologies Used:
Python: The project is implemented in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language.
Groq API: The chatbot uses Groq's language model API for generating responses.
